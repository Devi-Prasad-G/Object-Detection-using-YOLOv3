# Object-Detection-using-YOLOv3

This project aims at building custom object detector using YOLOv3 architecture.

- Initially pre-trained version of YOLOv3 model is used to perform object detection.
- Following this a custom object detector(tiger) is trained by using google apis interface to download data.
